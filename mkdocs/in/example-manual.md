## Functions

Functions manipulate the local shell variables, unlike commands, which are
executed by the shell as a subprocess.

### ```add-command```

kx add_command [help|--help|-help|-h|?] COMMAND_NAME

Add a command to the kx environment.

This will create the file
  /home/ewelton/Desktop/D/kbash/test/testdir/kx/kbash/commands/[COMMAND_NAME].sh
if it does not exist.  You should then edit this file to implement.
The template file used in creation is located at
  /home/ewelton/Desktop/D/kbash/setup/command.sh
You will want to edit 3 things
 1. The oneline help summary that is used in other contexts
 2. The print_help() function, which is the detailed help
 3. The run() function, which is executed as a subprocess



### ```add-component```

kx add_component [help|--help|-help|-h|?] [COMPONENT] [KXX]

Add a new component

This will set up a component.



### ```add-function```

kx add_function [help|--help|-help|-h|?] FUNCTION_NAME

Add a function.

This will create the file
  /home/ewelton/Desktop/D/kbash/test/testdir/kx/kbash/functions/[FUNCTION_NAME].sh
if it does not exist.  You should then edit this file to implement.
The template file used in creation is located at
  /home/ewelton/Desktop/D/kbash/setup/function.sh
You will want to edit the 4 function stubs
 1. oneline_help_kx_[FUNCTION_NAME]
 2. cmdline_help_kx_[FUNCTION_NAME]
 3. help_kx_[FUNCTION_NAME]
 4. run_kx_[FUNCTION_NAME]



### ```bundle```

kx bundle [help|--help|-help|-h|?] [Bundle Commend Line]

Runs the project specific bundle


This runs the correctly scoped bundle - ruby requires
a complete path to the bundle wrapper in order to
set the environment correctly.



### ```cd```

kx cd [help|--help|-help|-h|?] [PATH]

cd /home/ewelton/Desktop/D/kbash/test/testdir/kx/[PATH] (or base w/o arg)

This is a shell function, which execute cd as follows:
  cd /home/ewelton/Desktop/D/kbash/test/testdir/kx/[PATH].

If no PATH is provided, this just cds into
  cd /home/ewelton/Desktop/D/kbash/test/testdir/kx



### ```deactivate```

kx deactivate [help|--help|-help|-h|?] 

Restores key variables to boot state



### ```kbash-env```

kx kbash_env [help|--help|-help|-h|?] 

Display current environment settings.

kx env



### ```kbash-os```

kx kbash_os [help|--help|-help|-h|?] 

Display os

This command will report what the kbash utilities think the current operating
system is.

You can use the following functions in the shell environment (or your own)
scripts, if you want a quick check to determine your operating system
- is_osx
- is_linux
- is_windows

This is based off of ```uname``` - so.  You can use kbash-os to show you
the uname output and check the value so is_osx, is_linux, is_windows

For example:
```shell 

  > kx kbash-os
  Checking os: uname ='Linux kisia 4.15.0-48-generic #51-Ubuntu SMP Wed Apr 3 08:28:49 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux'
  Linux Detected
  >
```



### ```kbash-troff```

kx kbash_troff [help|--help|-help|-h|?] 

disable KBASH_TRACE

This is equivalent to
  export KBASH_TRACE=false



### ```kbash-tron```

kx kbash_tron [help|--help|-help|-h|?] 

set KBASH_TRACE to trace KBASH internals

This is equivalent to
  export KBASH_TRACE=true



### ```parallel```

kx parallel [help|--help|-help|-h|?] MAXJOBS

Control how many jobs run in parallel.


Control how many jobs run in parallel



### ```reset```

kx reset [help|--help|-help|-h|?] 

Reload the environment.

In this shell, execute:
  /home/ewelton/Desktop/D/kbash/test/testdir/kx/activate.sh

This will cause the entire kx runtime to be reloaded,
so any changes to functions or commands will be processed.

This will update the activation count from 0 to 1



### ```troff```

kx troff [help|--help|-help|-h|?] 

Stop bash execution trace.

Equivalent to
  set +x



### ```tron```

kx tron [help|--help|-help|-h|?] 

Start bash execution trace.

Equivalent to
  set -x

## Commands

### ```about```

```shell 
kx <command> [help]

kx is a bash environment supporting development.

kx is pure anti-pattern, in includes
 - 'within-environment' mutations- bash functions allow forward mutation of the
   active environment, with no guarantees of any stable state, save the single
   application of this function after a clean reset
 - pure 'side-effect' focus.  This is an attempt to identify mutators to the
   filesystem, and to codify them.  All functions and commands in the
   environment are expected to operate upon the filesystem directly.  git
   provides us exceptional visiblity into changes over the active checkout.

kx supports the development of ad-hoc tasks required
to effectively build a complex, multi-project system.

As knowledge is captured w/in the kx script system, it is added
into the compiled node or python build support tools.  But when you have to
adapt to an existing culture, as in a fork, you need a little grease.  The
node and python knowledge is the organized grease to glue a complete system
onto a consistent base.

kx uses a "Convention over Configuration" and heavily seeds a
bash operating environment with functions and variables, supporting
multi-tech integration projects.  The ability to "regenerate" the environment
from the kx reset command means that scripts can be rapidly
edited and applied - recorded in a pull-request, and the collective wisdom
knitting forward.

kx can be rapidly and ad-hoc adjusted, and it is specific to
this repository.  The bashenv orchestrates the connection of the environment
with a conversational mutator - a live bash shell.  As this is bound to a
repository top, the space underneath is managed - so this is effectively a
bash shell over a commit-trail of reference.

kx is scoped by directory (or checkout) - based on the KXX
variable.
  KXX = /home/ewelton/Desktop/D/kbash/test/testdir/kx

For more information, check out this file:

In general use kx [cmd] help for more information.
